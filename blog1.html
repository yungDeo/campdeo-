                    </p>
                    <p > So you graduated college? You have your degree in computer science with a minor in math and have a grade point average that is above a 3.0? You were a one sport Athlete. You managed to pay some of your way through college by working three or more jobs. You spend countless night programming or washing dishes at a fast food job to fuel your passion in technology. Now you are ready to see all that hard work pay off. It’s harvest season. It is time to reap the seed you planted. What most people don’t know about harvest season, it’s hard work.</p>
                    <p > Once you start your job search, your realized you have work to do. At this stage of the game, there is many languages, frameworks, and environments. Different companies have different requirements that you must meet to acquire that job. The first reaction is to be mad at your institution for being unspecific in what you must do to get a job. Upon thinking about it, you are more grateful in your abilities to analyze algorithms, data structures, and your ability to learn abstract programming languages rather quickly.</p>
                    <p > Most entry level jobs or Junior require at least 2 years of technical experience with a degree. There is also a possibility of learning security. Don't worry there are ways around that. It requires grit and a GitHub account. Getting a technical job requires lifelong learning and you must be willing to do. What do you learn first? There is Ruby on Rails. Ruby is a programing language. Rails is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby. You can also choose to learn Bootstrap and node.js. The list goes on and on but Just learn. My best advice is to work like you are the C.E.O of your own company with no employees. If you don't want start from scratch take what you know and what you are good at and pick a framework that goes well with that. So pick a framework, learn it and publish all of your work. Rinse and repeat until you find a technical job.</p>
