Blog Post 1: The Paradox of Choice</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	So you graduated
college?  You have your degree in computer science with a minor in
math and have a grade point average that is above a 3.0?  You were a
one sport Athlete.    You managed to pay some of your way through
college by working three or more jobs.  You spend countless night
programming or washing dishes at a fast food job to fuel your passion
in technology.  Now you are ready to see all that hard work pay off. 
It’s harvest season. It is time to reap the seed you planted.  What
most people don’t know about harvest season, it’s hard work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	Once you start your
job search, your realized you have work to do.  At this stage of the
game, there is many languages, frameworks, and environments. 
Different companies have different requirements that you must meet to
acquire that job.  The first reaction is to be mad at your
institution for being unspecific in what you must do to get a job. 
Upon thinking about it, you are more grateful in your abilities to
analyze algorithms, data structures, and your ability to learn
abstract programming languages rather quickly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">	Most entry level
jobs or Junior require at least 2 years of technical experience with
a degree. There is also a possibility of learning security. Don't
worry there are ways around that.  It requires grit and a GitHub
account.  Getting a technical job requires lifelong learning and you
must be willing to do.   What do you learn first? There is Ruby on
Rails. Ruby is a programing language. Rails is a server-side web
application framework written in Ruby. You can also choose to learn
Bootstrap and node.js. The list goes on and on but Just learn. My
best advice is to work like you are the C.E.O of your own company
with no employees. If you don't want start from scratch take what you
know and what you are good at and pick a framework that goes well
with that. So pick a framework, learn it and publish all of your
work.  Rinse and repeat until you find a technical job.</p>
